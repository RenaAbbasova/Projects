E_commerce_project


Objective:
The primary aim of this project is to construct an unsupervised learning model for customer analysis using the RFM methodology.

Project Description:
In this project, we conduct an analysis and segmentation of customers from an e-commerce enterprise by implementing the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) framework. Furthermore, we investigate the identification of the most active day, which provides insights into customer behavioral patterns.

Key Findings:
A significant insight we have derived from our analysis is the successful identification of prime customers.

Recommendation Engine:
We have developed a recommendation engine that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This engine is based on multiple recommendation strategies and a sophisticated filtration approach. The focus is on determining the degree of similarity between customers, primarily based on the products they have purchased. Through NLP-based methods, we enhance our ability to make personalized and accurate recommendations, improving the overall customer experience.
